    This paper is aimed to introduce the reader to the concept of garbage
    collection. Outlining modern algorithms for garbage collection, their scope
    and strategies while comparing garbage collection with other memory
    management techniques. The goal is to explain introduced ideas using
    examples written in \textit{Go} and \textit{Java} as well as highlighting
    their garbage collection implementations and the ideas and theorems behind
    them while contrasting trade-offs either implementations had to make.
