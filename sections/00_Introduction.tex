\section{Introduction}

Garbage collection refers to the process of automatically managing
heap allocated memory on behalf of the running process by
identifying parts of memory that are no longer needed. \cite[Introduction]{go_gcguide_2022}
This is often performed by the runtime of a programming language while the
program is executing. \cite[Introduction]{go_spec_2023}

Most programming languages allocate values with static lifetimes
\footnote{variable available for the whole runtime of the
program \cite[Abstract]{static-dynamic-scope_tanter_2009}} in main memory along
with the executable code or values which are alive for a certain scope using
the call stack \footnote{stores information about running
subroutines / functions \cite[2.2 Call Stacks]{call-stack_mcmaster-memon_2006}}
without requiring dynamic allocation. Variables that are alive for a certain
scope can not escape the call stack, thus can't escape the scope they were
defined in and must be dynamically allocated if accessing them outside of their
scope is desired. This requires the programmer to allocate and deallocate these
variables to prevent memory leaks\footnote{allocated no longer needed
memory not deallocated \cite[1.2.1 A Practical Object Ownership
Model]{practical_heine-lam_2003}} provided the programming language does not
perform garbage collection.
