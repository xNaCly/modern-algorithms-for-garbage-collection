\section{Introduction}

Garbage collection describes the process of automatically allocating and
deallocating memory a process requires. \cite{python_gcdesign_2023} This is
commonly performed by the runtime the compiler embeds into the resulting
executabe or the runtime the interpreter provides to the program it currently
executes. \cite{go_gcguide_2022, python_gclib_2023}
